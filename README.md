# Iris Project

## Introduction

The Iris Project involves predicting the species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is obtained from scikit-learn and is used for multi-class classification.

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Visualize and understand the Iris dataset.
   - Analyze relationships between attributes and flower species.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and explore the Iris dataset using Pandas.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Implement a simple baseline model.
   - Train a Logistic Regression model for accurate predictions.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess model accuracy using cross-validation.
   - Visualize misclassifications and predictions.

5. **Model Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the Logistic Regression model for optimal performance.

6. **Final Model:**
   - Train the final Logistic Regression model on the complete training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model on the testing dataset.

## Methods Used

- **Logistic Regression:** Utilized for multi-class classification.
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib for exploring dataset characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames for handling and analyzing data.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Logistic Regression with cross-validation for accuracy assessment.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy on the testing dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Iris flower species based on provided attributes.

## Conclusion

The Iris Project showcases the application of machine learning for multi-class classification. Further enhancements, such as exploring advanced models or additional feature engineering, could be considered for improving predictive accuracy.
